        "## Overview\n",
        "For this assignment, imagine that you are working as an engineer with expertise in climate change analysis, and the state of Colorado has asked you to provide an assessment of historical climate change. Your goal is to assess how annual average temperature and annual average precipitation have been changing in the state. In addition to the maps and graphs you create, you will need to provide them with an interpretion and discussion of your results (in the discussion questions).  \n",
        "\n",
        "**Objectives:**\n",
        "1. Explore temperature and precipitation change in Colorado.  \n",
        "2. Use maps and trend analysis to compare both the spatial and temporal patterns of change.\n",
        "3. Interpret your analysis based on climate variability and other topics discussed in lecture.\n",
